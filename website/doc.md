# Uses
  This folder contains all of the code files used on the webserver to either create frontend interfaces, be incorperated into the website, or are the backend connection files the front end calls. Environment variables were not set, passwords were hardcoded on the server, and removed for github uploads.

# fillDatabase.php
  This file reads in a .json file and puts the information into our database on the server.
  
# votingStyle.html
  This file was used to create the front end interface for users to input their vote. I uses post to send the data to a file on the server, which then correctly implements the users vote.
